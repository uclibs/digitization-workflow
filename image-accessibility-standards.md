Prepared by Sidney Gao and James Van Mil -- September 2021

The Digital Content Team is dedicated to ensuring that newly created
digital collections are accessible to all users. This document addresses
the accessibility standards by which images (JPGs or TIFs) in newly
created collections will be held. These standards will not be applied to
existing images ingested to a UC Libraries repository.

This plan outlines a progressive approach for supporting the
accessibility needs of images stewarded by the Digital Content Team.
Further attention is needed to understand how to support the
accessibility of born-digital collections, which is outside the scope of
this document.

Image Descriptions and Alternative Text

The Digital Content Team will create image descriptions for all individual
images in new digital collections. Images that appear within another
format, such as a photograph as part of a newspaper article, will receive
alternative text (alt-text).

Both image descriptions and alt-text will follow [guidelines set by the
American Anthropology Association](https://www.americananthro.org/ImageDescriptions?navItemNumber=25126#difference).
Definitions of each are as follows:

- An **image description** is a detailed explanation of an image that provides
textual access to visual content; most often used for digital graphics online
and in digital files; can be used as alt text in coding to provide access to
more complete information.

- **Alt-text** is a brief textual explanation of an image, used in the coding of
digital graphics online and in digital files; alt text is not visible on
websites unless the image does not appear.

### The Plan

For focused digital collections, the DCT will address image accessibility
remediation as part of the standard digitization workflow.

Should providing image accessibility remediation exceed the current capacity
of the DCT (either due to existing project workload or large collection size),
project stakeholders will collaborate on a plan to provide image descriptions
and/or alt-text. This will likely result in training one or two extra student
staff members to work on image accessibility remediation; the DCT will review
and QC image descriptions prior to ingest.
