### Capacity

We are able to digitize most book and paper materials. This includes,
but is not limited to:

-   Blueprints

-   Documents

-   Manuscripts

-   Maps

-   Monographs

-   Photographs

-   Posters & prints

We are unable to reformat most audio-visual media. This includes, but is
not limited to:

-   8mm film

-   16mm film

-   VHS or UMatic tapes

-   Cassettes

-   Reel to reel audio

-   Vinyls

Our ability to take on new digitization projects depends largely on our
existing backlog, the scale of the proposed project, and the condition
of the physical collection:

-   If there exists a considerable backlog of approved projects, we may
    close applications for new proposals

-   If the the physical collection is in poor or questionable condition,
    a meeting should be set with The Preservation Lab to determine
    suitability for digitization

-   If the collection to be digitized is large (5,000+ unbound pages, or
    2,500+ bound pages), a detailed project plan may be required to
    manage expectations, specify funding sources, and create
    reasonable timelines

### Equipment

Digital Imaging @ The Preservation Lab uses a Phase One IQ360 60MP
Digital back to reformat all Special Collections material

-   For materials reformatted on this copystand, post processing occurs
    on a 2015 iMac running OSX El Capitan. It has a 4GHz Intel Core i7
    processor and 32GB of RAM.

Materials appropriate for flatbed scanning are reformatted on an Epson
Expression 10000XL.

-   For materials reformatted on this flatbed scanner, post processing
    occurs on a Dell Precision T5600 desktop running Windows 10. It
    has a 2GHz Intel(R) Xeon(R) processor with 16GB of RAM.
