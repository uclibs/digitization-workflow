Prepared by Sidney Gao and James Van Mil -- Updated August 2020

Digital preservation efforts are vital to ensuring that UCLâ€™s newly digitized
collections remain accessible for future generations of scholars and researchers.
The Digital Collections Team is dedicated to ensuring that newly digitized
collections are responsibly stewarded, with the same care that is taken with
physical collections. The purpose of these guidelines are to set achievable
digital preservation standards for all newly created digital collections.

### Scope

These guidelines outline a progressive approach for supporting the digital
preservation needs of the digitized content stewarded by the Digital Collections
Team. Further attention is needed to understand how to support born-digital
collections, which is outside the scope of this document.  

For any questions about this document, or about the current digital preservation
guidelines, please contact the Digital Collections Team at
<digitalcontent@ucmail.uc.edu>.

### Standards

The team works diligently to gradually and consistently research and implement
standards set by the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) and the NDSA
Levels of Digital Preservation, facilitated by the Digital Preservation
Capability Maturity Model (DPCMM).

-   **Open Archival Information System (OAIS)** -- The OAIS model for
    digital preservation has been widely accepted as the standard for
    repositories of cultural heritage digital content. Where some
    discussions of digital preservation focus on technology, this model
    equally emphasizes the importance of technology, management, and
    resources. This holistic approach will allow us to build a stable
    digital preservation program capable of growth, while customizing
    policies to UCL-specific needs.

-   **NDSA Levels of Digital Preservation** -- The NSDA Levels of
    Digital Preservation focus on the technical infrastructure needed to
    properly steward and maintain digital collections. Technology often
    overshadows other aspects of digital preservation for a reason:
    technology *is* crucial to maintain digital content. When used in
    conjunction with the OAIS, the NDSA Levels of Digital Preservation
    can guide UCL's digital preservation program.

-   **Digital Preservation Capability Maturity Model (DPCMM)** -- The
    DPCMM is an assessment tool that allows institutions to self-assess
    the maturity of their digital preservation program according to both
    OAIS and NDSA Levels standards. This tool provides detailed analysis
    of fifteen assessment points and suggests next steps to improve upon
    existing digital preservation activities. Following the DPCMM's plan
    for growing UCL's digital preservation program will ensure that OAIS
    and NDSA Levels standards are met simultaneously.


### Guidelines

Our current Digital Preservation Guidelines are written below, and will be
evaluated annually by the Digital Collections Team. These standards will be
applied to all newly digitized collections at UC Libraries.

-   Preservation copies of all newly digitized content will take the
    form of Open Source Technology Neutral (OS/TN) formats only

    -   For most of our newly digitized collections, these formats will
        be TIFs and PDF/UAs

    -   Preservation metadata will be stored on CSV files

-   Preservation copies and preservation metadata of all digital objects
    in a new digital collection will be stored in a minimum of two (2)
    of these three locations at any given time:

    -   Phase One NAS

    -   Isilon storage

    -   APTrust

    In addition, both Isilon storage and APTrust regularly back up
    servers, providing an extra layer of protection against unexpected
    disasters.

-   BagIt will be used to create MD5 checksums for every new digital
    collection, and checksums will be verified after every file
    transfer.

-   The Digital Collections Team will maintain documentation logging
    permissions and access of relevant stakeholders.

    -   No one individual will have R/W access to all copies of digital
        content

    -   Members of the Digital Collections Team combined will have R/W access
        to all copies of digital content.

-   Due to our limiting capacity, minimum viable preservation metadata
    will be stored with each digitized collection:

    -   Reference, context, and provenance information

    -   Fixity information

    -   Content data object description  

    Preservation metadata will be stored on CSV files and packaged alongside
    preservation copies of digital objects.
