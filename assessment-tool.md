The [Digital Collection Assessment Tool](https://uclibs.github.io/digitization-workflow//assets/assessment-tool.docx) was created by and for the Digital Collections Team
to assess new and existing digital collections. Assessing our collections is
vital to ensuring proper allocation of resources. Assessing a digital collection includes the following:  

#### Project Description  
Is the project currently a "maintenance" or "growth" project?

#### Ongoing Support
What resources and activities are currently being dedicated to
support the collection?

#### Digital Preservation
What digital preservation activities are currently being performed for the
collection?

#### Audience, Usage, and Impact
Have you met usage goals since the collection was last assessed? What impact
has this collection had on its intended audience?

#### Action Plan
Formulate a plan for stewarding this collection moving forward.
