### Values

To develop this document, we drew from the [University of Cincinnati
mission](https://www.uc.edu/about/mission.html):

> We are committed to excellence and diversity in our students, faculty,
> staff, and all of our activities. We provide an inclusive environment
> where innovation and freedom of intellectual inquiry flourish.

The [UC Libraries
Tenets](https://libraries.uc.edu/about/core-beliefs.html):

> Diversity, Equity & Inclusion -- We value, celebrate and promote
> diversity, equity & inclusion in our workforce and in the communities
> we serve. Our services, resources and collections reflect the
> diversity of the world and highlight marginalized and previously
> unseen communities.

And inspiration from the article: [Why Do We Digitize? The Case for Slow
Digitization](http://www.archivejournal.net/essays/why-do-we-digitize-the-case-for-slow-digitization/)

> If digital libraries merely reiterate and reinforce long-standing
> cultural narratives and stereotypes, rather than enabling the
> exploration of forgotten and neglected collections, then they can
> become agents of cultural exclusion.

### Collection Strategy

The University of Cincinnati Libraries Digital Content Team prioritizes
the selection and digitization of collections that amplify the voices of
marginalized and unseen communities. We value the creation of digital
collections that exist at the intersection of diversity, inclusion, and
accessibility -- both the content and delivery of our collections
reflects these values.

Our work highlights rare and unique collections at the University of
Cincinnati Libraries, and reifies the libraries' commitment to
representing the diverse community it serves.

### In Practice

#### Selection

Digital collection development capacity is scarce. To balance priority
and risk, and to ensure sustainable, suitable collections, the Digital
Content Team has developed guidance to support the selection of
materials for digitization. The guidance promotes the selection of
curated special collections materials while considering priorities and
restrictions that will be balanced through project planning.

To encourage the development of collections that support UC Libraries'
commitment to diversity, we maintain a priority project queue for
collections that amplify the voices of marginalized and unseen
communities.

#### Format Content Standards

Infrastructure is also scarce. To meet users at their point of need, we
have adopted the PDF/UA format as our preferred output for public
access. PDF/UA format is user-focused, flexible, portable, and aligns
with our focus on document-based digitization. It uses widely available
tools, does not depend on a platform-based infrastructure for
dissemination or reuse, and meets the accessibility goals of the
University of Cincinnati.

We also support other file formats, as appropriate to the project, with
a focus on text and image digitization.
