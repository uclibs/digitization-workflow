Prepared by James Van Mil and Sidney Gao -- June 2020

The success of digitization project execution depends on the
collaboration of stakeholders from multiple units across the University
of Cincinnati Libraries. Digitization projects may range from focused,
in-house digitization to large-scale, out-sourced digitization. This
document will identify how to plan different types of digitization
projects.

### **Project types**

### Basic Digitization Projects

Basic digitization projects are characterized by simplicity in managing
the execution of the workflow - all stages of the workflows are able to
be completed through established, in-house workflows. Workflow steps for
this type of project include:

-   **Selection & Profiling** --identification of an item or a
    collection for digitization, including the identification of
    digitization needs

-   **Digitization** -- imaging or reformatting of materials into a
    digital format

-   **Digital Preservation Planning** -- documenting file format risk
    and storage needs

-   **Accessibility Review** -- reviewing and correcting basic content
    accessibility issues

-   **Metadata Review** -- consulting with selector to ensure
    well-formatted metadata and advising on appropriate standards or
    vocabularies

-   **Ingest & Verification** -- loading content into the destination
    repository and performing quality assurance checks; finalizing
    project documentation

### Advanced Digitization Projects

Advanced digitization projects are characterized by targeting an
expanded project scope, beyond what typical digitization and ingest
workflows can fulfil. The selector (or their designee) should expect to
serve as a project manager, with overall responsibility for coordinating
resources for the project.

Advanced project needs will vary -- some will be marginally more complex
than basic projects, and other will involve coordination of effort
across multiple departments within UCL.  

### **Starting a Digitization Project**

If you have any questions about starting a project, please contact the
Digital Content Team at <digitalcontent@ucmail.uc.edu>.

As you start work on any project, please review the [Selection
Guidelines](https://uclibs.github.io/digitization-workflow/digitization-selection-guidelines/). This document will help you to
understand what materials are well-suited for digitization projects.

If your project is a **basic digitization project**, the first step is
to complete the [Digital Collection Project Profile](https://uclibs.github.io/digitization-workflow/digitization-project-profile/).
The Digital Content Team is available to consult and support
the completion of the project profile. After this document is complete
and verified by the digital content team, the project will be added to
the digital collections workflow queue. The Digital Content Team
maintains two workflow queues: one for projects that demonstrate
potential for success, and an additional queue for projects which, in
addition to demonstrating potential for success, **also** **amplify
hidden voices though digitizing collections that represent historically
underrepresented groups.**

If your project is an **advanced digitization project**, the first step
is to identify an advocate who will serve as project manager - this will
often be the selector. Next, the project manager should work to identify
what will be needed to successfully digitize the materials. Working with
the Digital Content Team to complete the Digital Collection Project
Profile will help to identify these project needs. This is likely to
include any of the following needs:

-   **Preservation treatment** -- preparing fragile materials for
    digitization

-   **Outsourced digitization** -- working with an non-UCL partner or
    vendor to complete workflow where in-house digitization cannot
    accommodate the quantity or formats

-   **Metadata creation/cataloging support** -- metadata creation or
    cataloging; metadata training for student workers

-   **Accessibility support** -- addressing challenging content needs,
    e.g., transcription of handwriting or archaic type, table
    formatting, image description

Although the digital content team will coordinate the integration of
advanced workflow needs with the digitization workflow, the
selector/project manager shall be responsible for arranging, managing,
and, if necessary, funding this advanced work.

To ensure the success of an advanced digitization project, the project
manager should prepare a project plan outlining participant
contributions and general timelines for completion. This project plan
should include inputs from all stakeholders, and indicate their roles in
the project.

The [Digitization Project Scope document](https://uclibs.github.io/digitization-workflow/assets/digitization-project-scope-template.docx) may serve
as a template for project planning. In cases where advanced digitization
project needs are minimal (e.g., when the project integrates existing
workflows for preservation treatment, or other technical/metadata
support), the need for additional project documentation may be waived.

If the project depends on external funding for success, the Digital
Content Team should be involved in planning for digitization at the
beginning stages of the project.
